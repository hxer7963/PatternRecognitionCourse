#### PatternRecognitionCourse

pattern recognition course in Nanjing unversity which is taught by [Jianxin Wu](<http://cs.nju.edu.cn/wujx/>). Professor Wu is a scholar with many years of practical experience in the field of computer vision.

The lecture notes which are uploaded in the `./materials/` are clear and systematic.

Overall, the course is nice for me, homework is not vary difficult, but it takes me a lot of energy to reproduce the **DDT** paper in the Ex_Course.

In addition, you can get the latest news on the [course homepage](<http://cs.nju.edu.cn/wujx/teaching_PR.html>).
